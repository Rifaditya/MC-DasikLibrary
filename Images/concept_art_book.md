# Concept: Cool Book SVG Icon

Goal: Create a "cool", white SVG icon representing "Dasik Library".

## Option 1: The Core Matrix Tome 💾

**"The Tech Library"**

* **Visual**: An open book where the "text" lines are actually **circuit traces**. They connect to a central glowing node (the "Core").
* **Why**: Fits "Core Mod" and "Library".
* **Style**: Sharp, geometric, all white lines.

## Option 2: The Ethereal Archive 👻

**"The Hive Mind"**

* **Visual**: A book that isn't fully solid. The top of the pages dissolves into **floating pixels/shards** rising upward.
* **Why**: Fits the "Hive Mind" / "Pulse" / "Signal" nature of the mod. It implies data in motion.
* **Style**: Dynamic, motion-focused, solid white fragments.

## Option 3: The Split Reality 🌗

**"The Brand Match"**

* **Visual**: Matches your "Half and Half" Logo.
  * **Left Page**: Solid White filled.
  * **Right Page**: White Outline (Wireframe) / Negative space.
* **Why**: Perfect consistency with your `Wizaeds O` logo aesthetic.
* **Style**: Clean, bold, iconic.

## Option 4: The Monolith 🟦

**"The Stack"**

* **Visual**: A 3D isometric stack of books, but they look like server blades or lego blocks.
* **Why**: Represents "Structure" and "Foundation" (Dependency).
* **Style**: Isometric, minimalist, 3D effect.

**Which vibe do you prefer?** OR, suggest a mix (e.g., "Option 2 but with Option 1's circuits").
